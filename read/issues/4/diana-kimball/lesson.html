    <div class="piece-body l-col-reading entry-content l-mm c-issue">
      <p>The happy news came over Twitter: Ellen was going to work at Kickstarter. All I could feel was anger rising in my throat.</p>

<p>Ellen and I met through mutual friends in 2008. At the time, we were studying at two different colleges in the same city; I was one year ahead. We learned that weâd both grown up in Michigan. Cast on similar paths by our shared interest in technology, we both interned at Microsoft and took jobs there as program managers after graduation. For a summer, we even worked on the same team in Mountain View. We both applied to the same business school; we both got in. Our paths were symmetrical in the extreme.</p>

<p>And now Ellen was going to work at Kickstarter, just months after Iâd finished an internship there. Because Ellen had deferred business school for longer than I had, she was available for full-time work. Meanwhile, I was halfway through a two-year program, and committed to finishing in spite of myself. Yet the happy news still sent me reeling. I had always been a year ahead, but now Ellen had caught upâand in one important way, surpassed me. My face burned.</p>

<p>It took me weeks to write a measured note of congratulations. It took longer for me to come to terms with the implosion. As I wrote in a journal at the time, âI feel threatened by what we have in common. I donât want to be replaceable.â</p>

<p>I knew my anger wasnât about Ellen. I knew that. But my face still burned, my throat still tightened. My insecurity was unbecoming. I just didnât know how to unmake it.</p>

<p>All of that happened in 2012. In time, the intensity receded. I graduated from business school; I took a job at SoundCloud; I moved to Berlin. And then one day in early 2014, I saw on Twitter that Ellen had written a blog post about how she came to work at Kickstarter. Interested, and sensing in myself the necessary calm, I clicked through.</p>

<p>Right there, in the second paragraph, I learned something Iâd never known: Ellen came to Kickstarter through me. âI found out that Kickstarter had a Product Manager opening when Diana Kimball tweeted about it on April 25, 2012,â she wrote. That tweet kicked off a six-month quest to work at Kickstarter, which ended in an emphatic yes. Reading Ellenâs story, I felt foolish, deflated, uplifted. All the old anger, long settled, drained away.</p>

<p>Ellen gave me one more gift. Days after her blog post, she sent an email to thank me, at several yearsâ remove, for being the way she found out about the opening at Kickstarter. And then, she said something surprising:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâve always felt a little bad about how similar our paths areâbetween Michigan, Boston, PowerPoint, Kickstarter, HBS. Iâve never been really sure what to do about it, because I think we just happen to have similar interests/skills. Iâm not sure why it makes me feel guilty, but I do hope you donât view it negatively.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She felt it too! Heartened by the revelation, by the symmetry of our perceptions, my reply tumbled out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel I can be very honest hereâyouâre not wrong! In fact, when I first heard that youâd taken the job at Kickstarter in fall 2012, I experienced a highly-charged heart-sinking sensation. After sitting with that for a few hours and talking it over with Erik (who happened to be there with me), I realized that whatever I was experiencing was important information, but that it was absolutely not about youâ¦ Today, I feel no twinge about the similarities in the paths weâve taken. Your choices are so fully your own, and Iâm just happy to exist in the same orbit, collecting experiences that weâll be able to compare and contrast and chuckle over whenever our paths cross, as I hope they keep doing for a long long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <em>The Gifts of Imperfection</em>, BrenÃ© Brown writes: âShame hates it when we reach out and tell our story. It hates having words wrapped around itâit canât survive being shared. Shame loves secrecy.â For a long time, Iâd kept my unbecoming reactions secret. By sharing her side of the story spontaneously, Ellen made room for me to unearth mine. The truth was embarrassing; a thrill; a relief.</p>
