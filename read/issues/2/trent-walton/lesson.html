      <p>âHow am I going to find a job? Where should I live? What if I canât afford car insurance? How does anyone ever find the money to buy a house? What happens if I get married and have kids? And, <em>oh God</em>, what about medical insurance? I havenât even begun to think about that! What am I going to do?â</p>

<p>âYouâll figure it out.â</p>

<p>Thatâs it? <em>Thatâs</em> the advice I get after what had to be a ten-minute gabble session from me over the phone with my dad (who was almost certainly flipping channels between the Formula One race highlights and the Barrett-Jackson car auction). Just before my graduation from college, <em>this</em> was his simple reply? But I wasnât surprised. Not at all. This was and is his <em>go-to</em> response, and Iâd heard it hundreds of times before.</p>

<p>I can see myself back in elementary school, out in the garage with my mechanical-engineer, industrial-contractor, grease-monkey father (whom I know Iâm <em>nothing</em> like). He was spending his Saturday doing what he lovesâtinkering, cursing, and bleeding all over his 1969 Shelby GT 500. Heâs had this car since 1970 when he convinced a used-car lot owner to hold it for him until he got that job at US Steel. His college paper route didnât yield enough for the down payment. He knows that car inside and out, especially after having to rebuild it when my mom accidentally flooded it by driving through a low water crossing after a tropical storm.</p>

<p>I was having a problem with my fourth-grade math teacher and had just finished explaining this (over garbled speech and ratcheting noises) to his feet, the only part of him not under the car. âSheâs always singling me out, but itâs not just me. Itâs the entire table! They make jokes, and I canât help but laugh. Now Iâm the only one with detention! Iâm the victim here. What am I going to do?â The teacher wouldnât even let me change my seat (not that I really wanted her to).</p>

<p>âYouâll figure it out.â</p>

<p>My ten-year-old brain couldnât help but think, âThis guy doesnât understand that I have <em>real</em> problems. School is hard. Life is hard. Iâve got so much to figure out, but he doesnât know what itâs like. Heâs an adult. Heâs got everything under control. Everything is easy for him.â It wasnât until much later in my life that I realized this wasnât true.</p>

<p>In 2006 I was contemplating going full time with our design company, Paravel, with two of my friends. My father had recently retired after spending thirty-five-plus years working at an industrial contracting company, which he started with two business partners in the 1970s (okay, so maybe weâre <em>somewhat</em> alike), working with companies like Shell and Dow. It was high-stakes work, and operating a small company like his that dealt with mega-corporations took gumption. When I reached out to him for business advice, his reply was the same. âYouâll figure it out.â</p>

<p>Occasionally, I catch him in a rare, contemplative mood and take advantage of that to pry out stories about life at the company. I truly thought things at his office were steady and predictable. I had no idea people got injured out in the field and that taking care of employees was the biggest part of his job. I hadnât known that big companies tend to push smaller companies around, delaying payment and chiseling estimates as much as they can. And I certainly had never even dreamt that he once had to put his beloved Shelby up as loan collateral to help pay his employees.</p>

<p>I realize now what my dad is best at: <em>figuring it out</em>. Heâs resourceful. Heâs a connector of dots. You can have all the pearls of wisdom, talent, and potential in the world, but if you canât string those qualities together theyâll never be put to good use.</p>

<p>It turns out that âYouâll figure it outâ was the best advice Iâve ever been given. It was a conditioner of sorts. It trained me to organize, dissect, and solve. It taught me how to head toward and be prepared for point B even when I donât yet see that it exists. It challenges me to be brave.</p>

<p>Gosh. Maybe Iâm more like my dad than I realize.</p>

<p>At least, I hope like hell I am.</p>
